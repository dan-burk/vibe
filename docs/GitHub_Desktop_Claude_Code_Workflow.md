# Using GitHub Desktop with Claude Code

You're coding with AI assistance. Claude makes changes to your files. Sometimes the changes work perfectly, sometimes they don't. You want to experiment boldly, but you need a safety net. Version control is like an unlimited undo button for your entire project—every commit creates a restore point you can always return to. When you combine [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), you get AI-speed development with professional version control.

## Key Concepts

- **Git** - Tracks every change to your files on your computer
- **GitHub** - Stores your code in the cloud as backup
- **GitHub Desktop** - Makes Git visual—you click buttons instead of typing commands
- **Claude Code** - AI coding assistant that writes code, fixes bugs, and creates commits for you

## What You'll Need

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) installed
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation) installed
- [GitHub](https://github.com) account (free)
- Web browser
- Basic terminal familiarity
- 20-25 minutes

## Step 1: Create Your Project

- Open **GitHub Desktop**
- Click **File** → **New Repository**
- Fill in:
  - **Name:** `simple-timer`
  - **Description:** `A timer app built with Claude Code`
  - **Local Path:** Documents folder
  - Check **Initialize this repository with a README**
- Click **Create Repository**
- Click **Publish repository** at the top
- Click **Publish Repository**

You now have a local project and cloud backup on GitHub.

## Step 2: Ask Claude to Create the Timer App

- Open your **terminal**
- Navigate to your project:
  ```
  cd ~/Documents/simple-timer
  ```
- Start Claude Code:
  ```
  claude
  ```
- Type this request:
  ```
  Create a simple countdown timer app in a single HTML file called timer.html.
  It should have:
  - An input field to set minutes
  - Start and Stop buttons
  - Display showing time remaining in MM:SS format
  - When timer reaches zero, display "Time's up!"
  Keep it simple with inline CSS and JavaScript.
  ```
- Press **Enter**

Claude creates the `timer.html` file (takes 10-30 seconds).

## Step 3: Test the Timer

- In GitHub Desktop, click **Repository** → **Show in Finder/Explorer**
- Double-click `timer.html` to open it in your browser
- Try the timer:
  - Type `1` in the input field
  - Click **Start**
  - Watch the countdown

**If it works:** Move to Step 5.
**If something's broken:** Continue to Step 4.

## Step 4: Fix Errors (If Needed)

- Open browser developer tools (press **F12** or right-click → **Inspect**)
- Click the **Console** tab
- Copy any red error messages
- Return to Claude Code in your terminal
- Paste the error:
  ```
  I'm seeing this error: [paste error]. Can you fix it?
  ```
- Refresh browser and test again

## Step 5: Review Changes

- Switch to **GitHub Desktop**
- **Left panel:** Shows changed files (`timer.html`)
- **Right panel:** Shows the code (green = added)
- Read through to understand what Claude created

Always review AI-generated code before committing.

## Step 6: Commit Manually

- At bottom left, in **Summary field**, type:
  ```
  Create initial timer app with start/stop functionality
  ```
- Click **Commit to main**

You've created a save point!

**Good messages:** "Create initial timer app", "Fix start button"
**Bad messages:** "changes", "update", "asdf"

## Step 7: Push to GitHub

- Click **Push origin** button at top
- Verify: Click **Repository** → **View on GitHub** to see your code online

Your code is now backed up in the cloud.

## Step 8: Add Sound Notification

- In Claude Code terminal:
  ```
  Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. Use the browser's
  built-in beep sound or create a simple audio alert.
  ```
- Press **Enter**
- Test: Refresh browser, set timer for 0.1 minutes, click Start

**For this tutorial:** Pretend the sound doesn't work well. Don't commit yet!

## Step 9: Discard Bad Changes

- Open **GitHub Desktop**
- Click **Branch** → **Discard All Changes**
- Click **Discard Changes** to confirm
- Refresh browser—timer works without the sound

You just threw away broken code and returned to your last save point.

## Step 10: Redo from Scratch

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  Add a sound notification when the timer reaches zero. This time, use an HTML5
  audio element with a simple beep sound generated by the Web Audio API. Make
  sure it handles browser autoplay restrictions gracefully.
  ```
- Test immediately (refresh browser, set 0.1 minutes, Start)

**If it works:** Continue to Step 11.
**If not:** Paste error to Claude or try again.

## Step 11: Let Claude Commit and Push

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  commit and push my changes
  ```
- Press **Enter**

Claude checks changes, writes a commit message, commits, and pushes (10-20 seconds).

**When to use:**
- Manual commits: When learning or want control
- Claude commits: When working fast and want good messages

## Step 12: Ask Claude to Summarize Changes

- In Claude Code:
  ```
  what files have I changed?
  ```

Claude explains your changes in plain English.

**Try:** `explain what the audio code does` or `show me the last 5 commits`

## Step 13: View History

- In **GitHub Desktop**, click the **History** tab

You'll see:
- Initial commit (README)
- Create initial timer app
- Add improved sound notification

Notice the first failed sound attempt isn't there—you discarded it! Only working code made it into your commits.

## How to Reopen

**GitHub Desktop:** Start menu/Spotlight → type "GitHub Desktop"

**Claude Code:**
```
cd ~/Documents/simple-timer
claude
```

**Project files:** In GitHub Desktop → **Repository** → **Show in Finder/Explorer**

## Next Steps

Try adding features to your timer:

- **Preset buttons:** `Add three preset buttons: "5 min", "10 min", and "15 min"`
- **Pause button:** `Add a Pause/Resume button that toggles the timer state`
- **Better styling:** `Improve the visual design with a modern color scheme`

## Troubleshooting

- **"Authentication failed"** - In GitHub Desktop, click **File** (Windows) or **GitHub Desktop** (Mac) → **Preferences** → **Accounts** → Sign out and sign in again.
- **Claude says "not a git repository"** - Make sure you're in the right folder: `cd ~/Documents/simple-timer`
- **Timer doesn't work** - Open browser console (press **F12**), copy errors, paste to Claude.

## Workflow Overview

- Ask Claude to make changes
- Test in browser
- If it works → Review and commit
- If it fails → Discard and try again
- Push to GitHub
- Repeat

Manual commits when you want control. Claude commits when you want speed. Discard fearlessly—only commit working code!
